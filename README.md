# Café Sales Performance Dashboard - Excel Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic and insightful sales dashboards using Microsoft Excel. It leverages Excel's features, including pivot tables, slicers, and charts, to visualize and analyze café sales data effectively. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface that allows for dynamic exploration of the sales data.
*   **Pivot Tables:** Summarize and analyze large datasets with pivot tables to reveal hidden patterns and relationships.
*   **Slicers:** Enable interactive filtering of data, allowing users to focus on specific months, weekdays, or items.
*   **Visualizations:** Clear and concise charts present sales trends, item performance, sales by location, and payment method breakdowns.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Highlights critical metrics such as total revenue, highest revenue item, best-selling item, highest sales month, and highest sales day.

## Data Analysis Scope

The dashboard analyzes sales data from January to December 2023, providing insights into:

*   **Total Sales Per Item:** Identifies top-selling items.
*   **Number of Items Sold:** Tracks the quantity of each item sold.
*   **Sales by Location:** Compares sales performance across different locations (In-Store, Takeaway, Other).
*   **Monthly Sales Trend:** Visualizes sales fluctuations throughout the year.
*   **Sales During the Week:** Highlights sales patterns on different days of the week.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following technical skills within Microsoft Excel:

*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Organizing and formatting raw sales data for analysis.
*   **Pivot Table Creation and Manipulation:** Building and customizing pivot tables to summarize data.
*   **Slicer Implementation:** Connecting slicers to pivot tables and charts for interactive filtering.
*   **Chart Design:** Creating visually appealing and informative charts to communicate key insights.
*   **Formula Usage:** Employing Excel formulas to calculate KPIs and perform data transformations.
*   **Dashboard Design Principles:** Applying best practices for creating an effective and user-friendly dashboard.

## Insights and Recommendations (Based on the Sample Data)

The sample dashboard reveals several interesting insights:

*   **Salad** is the highest revenue item, suggesting strong customer preference.
*   **Juice** is the best-selling item, suggesting popular demand.
*   **January** sees the highest sales.
*   **Friday** is the day of the week with the highest sales.
*   Sales are generally lower during **April and May**, indicating potential seasonal fluctuations.
*   The **"Other"** sales channel is a significant contributor to revenue.

Based on these insights, the dashboard suggests the following recommendations:

*   Focus promotions on increasing sales of lower-selling items like **Cookies**.
*   Further promote popular items like **Juice and Salad**.
*   Consider seasonal menu items or discounts during **April and May** to boost sales.
*   Explore and optimize the **"Other"** sales channel for maximum impact.
